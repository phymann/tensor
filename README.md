	â€‹		Free energy per site for classical 2D Ising model is obtained using tensor renormalization group algorithm proposed in [cond-mat/0611687](http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0611687). This code is essentially a rewritten of [C++ version](http://itensor.org/docs.cgi?vers=cppv3&page=book/trg) into a Julia version.
