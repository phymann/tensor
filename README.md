# tensor
Examples of using methods like DMRG, MPS, Tensor network, etc, that involve manipulating tensors.

List:

1. [TRG.jl](https://github.com/phymann/tensor/blob/master/TRG.jl)
	Free energy per site for classical 2D Ising model is obtained using tensor renormalization group algorithm proposed in [cond-mat/0611687](http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0611687). This code is essentially a rewritten of [C++ version](http://itensor.org/docs.cgi?vers=cppv3&page=book/trg) in to Julia version.
